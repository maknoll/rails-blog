# Rails Blog

This is a neat small blogging software i developed for my own needs.
It features:

- Markdown markup
- Amazon S3 image hosting
- Heroku ready
- fluid CSS 3 and HTML5

It is not very generic. If you want to deploy it and run into trouble, it migth be the simplest if you just contact me.
